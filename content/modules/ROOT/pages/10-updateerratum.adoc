== Update Errata

Red Hat Product Errata are advisories on bug fixes, security, and
enhancement on software installed on your RHEL host, based on analysis
by Red Hat engineers. Red Hat Satellite provides a simple method for
applying these fixes to hosts. We’ll walk through those steps.

For more information on Red Hat Errata,
https://access.redhat.com/articles/2130961[please visit this page].

You’ll be taken to a page containing all the Errata contained in the
repositories we originally synchronized in the second challenge of this
lab.

Not all of these Errata apply to the hosts we’ve added to this Satellite
server. To view applicable and installable Errata, click on the
`+Installable+` radio boxes.

Let’s install all the Installable Errata to our two hosts.

Select all of the Errata we just filtered.

== Resolve Traces (Restart services that require it)

When software is updated on a host, software that runs as a service
require a restart before the updated software is loaded into memory.
Tracer will detect which of these services need to be restarted.

=====
.Resolve Traces
[%collapsible]
====

Click on the host `+rhel1+`.

.Host
image::errorhost.png[error host]

Do the following to resolve the traces.

[arabic]
. Click on the `+Traces+` tab. All the services that require restarting
are listed here. If no services require restart, this list would be
blank.
. Select all the services listed.
. Click `+Restart app+`.

.Restart host
image::tracesrestart.png[restart]

WARNING: Resolving traces might take a few minutes, especially for a
reboot, since the host will wait 60 seconds before initiating the
reboot.

When you view the `+Traces+` menu, the list will be empty signifying no
services require restart.

You can check on the status of the job by typing `+jobs+` button and then on the `+Resolve traces+` job.
