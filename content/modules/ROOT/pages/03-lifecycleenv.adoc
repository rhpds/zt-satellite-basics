== Create a Lifecycle environment

The application lifecycle is a concept central to Red Hat Satellite 6’s
content management functions. The application lifecycle defines how a
particular system and its software look at a particular stage. For
example, an application lifecycle might be simple; you might only have
a development stage and production stage. In this case the application
lifecycle might look like this:

* Development
* Production

However, a more complex application lifecycle might have further
stages, such as a phase for testing or a beta release. This adds extra
stages to the application lifecycle:

* Development
* Testing
* Beta Release
* Production

To find out more about lifecycle environments, please refer to
